### ARes-CNN

This repository is supplementary to our paper "Multivariate Time Series Regression on Seismic Data
Using Adaptive Residual CNNs" for reproducing our proposed modes and its respective performance. 
In this repository, I describe the model that i created plus the additional information on data processing and customized implementation on the proposed architectures. 
For any questions, please feel free to contact me.


### How to use
This repository contains a file named "ARes-CNN.py". The file contains the full code for the ARes-CNN model for our experiments. Preprocessing the data into sequences and a train and test set is necessary before utilizing the models. Please contact me for any questions regarding the preprocessing scheme.  


### Requirements
Usage of our code requires many packages to be installed on your machine. The most important packages are listed below:
* Numpy
* Tensorflow
* Keras
* Pandas
* Sklearn
