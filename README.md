### ARes-CNN

This repository is supplementary to our paper "Multivariate Time Series Regression on Seismic Data
Using Adaptive Residual CNNs" for reproducing our proposed modes and its respective performance. 
In this repository, I describe the model that I created plus the additional information on data processing and customized implementation on the proposed architectures. 
For any questions, please feel free to contact me.
